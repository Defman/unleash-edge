### Tools
* Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
* Copy the pre-commit hook in the hooks folder into .git/hooks/pre-commit

### Practices
* We use rustfmt (triggered from cargo fmt) to format our source code
* We try to keep to [conventional-commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) - This simplifies creating and keeping a changelog up to date as well as helping to decide which version to bump when releasing a new version
* We will adhere to [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
